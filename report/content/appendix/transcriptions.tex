\begin{drama}
    \Character{Friend}{friend}

    \friendspeaks: My name's [Friend] and this is my story to share that nothing is impossible and that anything can happen and nothing is insurmountable for us to pull through. Umm, Christmas '94, end of my first year out of high school, I was driving my first motor vehicle and I fell asleep behind the wheel and it mounted the footpath and I took out a power pole. Little TX Gemini '75 model, I had the power pole up the windscreen in front of me and he motor through my glove box and the power pole moved several inches in the ground. I was cut out and transported to PA hospital for the emergency stuff then under police escort out the highway and through the Brisbane PA hospital. I spent two and a half weeks in induced coma, the head specialist in PA hospital in Brisbane didn't bother doing chart up, told my parents he was too busy, I was running outta time. According to him, what they were told, if I lived, at best I would be a vegetable in a wheelchair. I spent two and a half weeks in an induced coma, three and a half months I was in the PA hospital, which I don't remember any of. If I was supposedly lucky enough, that's the specialists words and attitude to my parents, to get out of hospital in '95, I would be back in hospital by the end of '95 to have my leg amputated. Since I've been out of hospital, I've had no pain anywhere in my body and haven't once needed to be on any medication because of it, anything whatsoever, and I have all my limbs and nothing's been amputated or changed. The only downside, I can't smell, but the way life and society is well bloody hell, I can live with that! So cheers!
